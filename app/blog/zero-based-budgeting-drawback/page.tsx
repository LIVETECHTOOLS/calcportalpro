            Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a powerful budgeting technique that forces organizations to justify every dollar they plan to spend. Unlike traditional budgeting, which builds on last year’s figures, ZBB starts from scratch. While effective, it comes with notable drawbacks — the biggest being the time and resources required.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is Zero-Based Budgeting?</h2>
          <p>
            Zero-based budgeting is a financial planning method where each expense must be justified for each new budgeting cycle. Instead of assuming that last year’s expenses will continue, ZBB requires all departments to request funding starting from a “zero base.”
          </p>

          <h2>The Process of Zero-Based Budgeting</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify organizational goals and priorities.</li>
            <li>Break down budgets into decision units (departments, projects, or teams).</li>
            <li>Require justification for all expenses, not just new items.</li>
            <li>Rank proposals based on necessity and ROI.</li>
            <li>Allocate resources accordingly.</li>
          </ol>


          <h2>Main Drawback of Zero-Based Budgeting</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest drawback of zero-based budgeting is its <strong>complexity and time-consuming nature</strong>. Managers must provide detailed justifications for every expense, which can slow down the budgeting cycle and consume significant resources.
          </p>

          <h3>Other Potential Drawbacks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Requires extensive documentation and analysis.</li>
            <li>May discourage innovation if managers focus only on cost-cutting.</li>
            <li>Can lead to short-term thinking instead of long-term strategy.</li>
            <li>Not suitable for fast-moving startups or small teams with limited resources.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When Should You Use Zero-Based Budgeting?</h2>
          <p>
            ZBB is most effective when organizations need to cut costs, improve efficiency, or realign spending with strategic goals. It is commonly used during economic downturns, mergers, or restructuring.
          </p>

          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <h3>What is zero-based budgeting in simple terms?</h3>
          <p>
            Zero-based budgeting means starting from scratch each year and requiring justification for every expense, rather than assuming past expenses will carry over.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is zero-based budgeting difficult to implement?</h3>
          <p>
            It requires detailed documentation, consumes time, and places extra workload on managers to justify all spending requests.
          </p>

          <h3>Is zero-based budgeting better than traditional budgeting?</h3>
          <p>
            It depends. ZBB provides more control and efficiency but may not be practical for smaller organizations or those needing rapid decisions. Traditional budgeting is faster but less precise.
          </p>


          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The process of zero-based budgeting ensures that every expense is justified, making it a powerful tool for cost control and strategic alignment. However, the main drawback is its resource-intensive nature, which may outweigh its benefits for some organizations. Choosing between ZBB and traditional budgeting depends on your goals, resources, and long-term strategy.
