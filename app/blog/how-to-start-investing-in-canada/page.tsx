          How to Start Investing in Canada - What is MER in Investing
        </h1>

        <p>
          Investing in Canada can seem overwhelming at first. Between stocks,
          real estate, and mutual funds, knowing where to start is half the
          challenge. One of the most important concepts for Canadian investors
          to grasp is the <strong>MER (Management Expense Ratio)</strong>.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 my-6">
          <strong>Info:</strong> MER stands for Management Expense Ratio — the
          annual fee expressed as a percentage of assets charged by investment
          funds. It directly reduces your returns.
        </div>

        <h2>Why MER Matters in Investing</h2>
        <p>
          MER is one of the most overlooked costs when investing in mutual funds
          and ETFs. Even a difference of 1% can cost tens of thousands of
          dollars over a lifetime.
