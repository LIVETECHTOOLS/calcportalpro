      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Quick Answer (TL;DR)</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <strong>Yes, you can get a home loan if you owe taxes, but it depends on the situation.</strong> Most lenders will approve your mortgage if you have a payment plan in place or if the tax debt is small relative to your income. However, unpaid tax liens or large outstanding balances can delay or prevent approval.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Taxes Matter to Mortgage Lenders</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Lenders care about your tax situation because it affects your debt-to-income ratio, creditworthiness, and ability to repay the loan. They want to ensure you can handle both your mortgage payments and any tax obligations.

      <div className="space-y-6 mb-8">
        <div className="border rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Payment Plans (Installment Agreements)</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            If you have an active payment plan with the IRS, most lenders will approve your loan. The monthly payment is treated like any other debt and included in your debt-to-income ratio.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4">
            <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
              <strong>Good news:</strong> Payment plans show responsibility and don't typically prevent mortgage approval.

        <div className="border rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Outstanding Balances Without Payment Plans</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Small outstanding balances (under $1,000) are often acceptable. Larger balances may require you to set up a payment plan or resolve the debt before closing.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4">
            <p className="text-yellow-800 text-sm">
              <strong>Action needed:</strong> Consider setting up a payment plan or paying off the balance.

        <div className="border rounded-lg p-6">

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Tax liens must be resolved before closing. This means paying the debt in full or negotiating a settlement with the IRS.
          </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
        <li>
          <strong>Get current on payments</strong> — Set up an installment agreement with the IRS if you haven't already.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Document everything</strong> — Keep records of all tax correspondence, payment confirmations, and agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be transparent</strong> — Disclose your tax situation upfront to avoid surprises during underwriting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider timing</strong> — If possible, resolve tax issues before applying for a mortgage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work with professionals</strong> — Consult with a tax professional and mortgage broker who understand these situations.

        <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Example 1: Payment Plan Success</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Sarah owed $15,000 in back taxes and set up a $300/month payment plan. Her lender approved her mortgage because the payment was included in her debt-to-income ratio and she had a stable payment history.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Example 2: Small Balance Overlooked</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Mike had a $500 outstanding tax balance from the previous year. His lender didn't require resolution since it was small relative to his income and didn't affect his ability to repay the loan.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
