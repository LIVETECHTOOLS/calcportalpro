      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Why did my payment amount change?
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Payment amounts can change due to changes in your income, family situation, or eligibility for specific benefits. The CRA recalculates benefits annually based on your most recent tax return.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        No, FPT payments are only made on the scheduled quarterly dates. However, if you're experiencing financial hardship, you may be eligible for other emergency benefits or assistance programs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        What if I move to a different province?
