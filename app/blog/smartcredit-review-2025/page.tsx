      {/* Review intro */}
      <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        SmartCredit is a well-rounded credit monitoring and identity protection
        tool aimed at consumers who want daily insights and actionable steps to
        improve their credit. In this review we tested its dashboard, monitoring
        frequency, identity alerts, and extra tools like the Score Builder and
        Money Manager to see whether it delivers real value in 2025.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          SmartCredit offers <strong>daily TransUnion score updates</strong> and
          alerts for important account changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pricing typically ranges <strong>$19.95–$29.95/month</strong>, with
          trials available via promotional links.

        </li>
        <li>
          Best for users who want a single easy-to-use dashboard and solid
          identity alerts — not necessarily for those needing multi-bureau
          daily monitoring.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is SmartCredit?</h2>

        help you see accounts in one place and take corrective actions via the
        built-in Action Button system.
      </p>

        <strong>Info:</strong>{" "}

          SmartCredit pulls scores from TransUnion for daily updates — it does
          not always include all three bureaus on the base plan.
        </span>
      </div>

          activity and dark web monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Action Button Disputes</strong> — submit disputes and requests
          directly from the UI.
        </li>
        <li>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pros & Cons</h2>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-white border rounded-lg p-5 shadow">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">Pros</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Daily updates and clear score tracking.</li>
            <li>Actionable tools to dispute and fix errors.</li>
            <li>Identity monitoring and alerts included.</li>
            <li>User-friendly dashboard.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border rounded-lg p-5 shadow">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-red-700 mb-3">Cons</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Primary daily updates are TransUnion only (not always multi-bureau).</li>
            <li>No permanent free plan — mostly trial or paid tiers.</li>
            <li>Some premium features sit behind higher-tier plans.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Alternatives to Consider</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        If multi-bureau monitoring or strong identity insurance is essential,
        consider alternatives such as Experian, IdentityForce, or LifeLock which
        emphasize multi-bureau coverage or larger insurance limits. Each has a
        different price/feature tradeoff — SmartCredit is strong on value and
        usability.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How We Tested</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We used SmartCredit for several weeks across multiple accounts, tested
        alerts, dispute flow, and how guidance from Score Builder affected
        practical tasks. We evaluated value against price and checked
        compatibility with common user needs (alerts, monitoring, identity
        help).
