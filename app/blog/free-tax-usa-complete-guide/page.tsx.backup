          <p>
            Consider these factors when choosing your free tax filing method:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Income Level</h3>
          <p>
            Check the income limits for each program. If you make more than $79,000, you may need to use fillable forms or pay for software.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Tax Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            Simple returns (W-2 income, standard deduction) work well with free software. Complex returns may require paid options.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Need for Support</h3>
          <p>
            If you need help, consider VITA, TCE, or paid options with customer support.
          </p>

          <h3>4. State Tax Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Some free options don't include state returns, which may cost extra.
          </p>

          <h2>Tips for Successful Free Tax Filing</h2>
          <p>
            Follow these tips to ensure a smooth free tax filing experience:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Gather All Documents</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>W-2 forms from all employers</li>
            <li>1099 forms (interest, dividends, freelance income)</li>
            <li>Previous year's tax return</li>
            <li>Bank account information for direct deposit</li>
            <li>Social Security numbers for all family members</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Choose the Right Program</h3>
          <p>
            Start with the IRS Free File program finder tool to see which options you qualify for.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Double-Check Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            Review all entries carefully before filing. Simple errors can delay your refund.
          </p>

          <h3>4. File Early</h3>
          <p>
            Filing early helps prevent identity theft and ensures faster refunds.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h2>When to Consider Paid Tax Software</h2>
