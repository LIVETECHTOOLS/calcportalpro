      <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Retirement planning in 2025 requires a comprehensive approach that addresses changing economic conditions, evolving retirement vehicles, and shifting demographics. With longer life expectancies, rising healthcare costs, and uncertain Social Security benefits, building a secure retirement nest egg has never been more critical. This complete guide covers everything you need to know about retirement planning, from understanding different account types to creating a sustainable income strategy for your golden years.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        The Current State of Retirement Planning
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Retirement planning has evolved significantly in recent years, with new challenges and opportunities emerging. Understanding the current landscape is essential for making informed decisions about your retirement future.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Rising Life Expectancy
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Americans are living longer than ever, with life expectancy continuing to increase. This means retirement savings need to last 20-30 years or more, requiring more substantial nest eggs and careful planning for longevity risk.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Declining Pension Coverage
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Traditional defined-benefit pensions have largely disappeared from the private sector, shifting the responsibility for retirement savings from employers to individuals. This makes personal retirement planning more critical than ever.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Social Security Uncertainty
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        While Social Security is unlikely to disappear completely, future benefits may be reduced or the full retirement age may increase. Relying solely on Social Security for retirement income is no longer a viable strategy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Rising Healthcare Costs
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Healthcare costs continue to rise faster than general inflation, making healthcare planning a critical component of retirement planning. Medicare doesn't cover all expenses, and supplemental coverage is often necessary.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 my-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">2025 Retirement Planning Challenges:</h4>
        <ul className="text-blue-800 space-y-1">
          <li>• Longer life expectancies requiring more savings</li>
          <li>• Declining employer pension coverage</li>
          <li>• Uncertain Social Security future</li>
          <li>• Rising healthcare and long-term care costs</li>
          <li>• Low interest rates affecting fixed-income investments</li>
          <li>• Inflation eroding purchasing power</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Retirement Account Types
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Understanding the different types of retirement accounts is crucial for building a diversified retirement portfolio. Each account type has unique features, tax advantages, and contribution limits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        401(k) Plans
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        401(k) plans are employer-sponsored retirement accounts that allow employees to contribute pre-tax dollars, reducing current taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. The 2025 contribution limit is $23,000 for employees under 50, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Traditional IRAs
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Traditional IRAs allow individuals to contribute pre-tax dollars, with contributions potentially deductible depending on income and employer retirement plan coverage. The 2025 contribution limit is $7,000 for those under 50, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Roth IRAs
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contribution limits are the same as traditional IRAs, but income limits apply for eligibility.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        HSAs offer triple tax advantages: contributions are pre-tax, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. They can serve as powerful retirement savings vehicles, especially for healthcare costs in retirement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Self-Employed Retirement Plans
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Self-employed individuals have access to SEP-IRAs, Solo 401(k)s, and other retirement plans that allow for higher contribution limits than traditional IRAs, helping them catch up on retirement savings.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Retirement Savings Strategies
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Building a substantial retirement nest egg requires a strategic approach that maximizes tax advantages, takes advantage of employer benefits, and balances risk with growth potential.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Start Early and Contribute Consistently
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Time is the most powerful factor in retirement savings due to compound interest. Starting early, even with small amounts, can result in significantly larger retirement accounts than starting later with larger contributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Maximize Employer Matching
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment. Not taking advantage of employer matching is like leaving money on the table.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Increase Contributions Gradually
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Increase your retirement contributions gradually, especially when you receive raises or bonuses. This allows you to save more without significantly impacting your current lifestyle.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Diversify Account Types
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Having both pre-tax (traditional) and after-tax (Roth) retirement accounts provides tax diversification in retirement, allowing you to manage your tax burden more effectively.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Consider Catch-Up Contributions
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        If you're 50 or older, take advantage of catch-up contributions to accelerate your retirement savings. These additional contributions can help make up for lost time if you started saving late.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Investment Strategies for Retirement
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        How you invest your retirement savings significantly impacts your long-term returns and retirement security. A well-diversified portfolio that balances growth and preservation is key to retirement success.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Asset Allocation by Age
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        A common rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 100 to determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks. However, this should be adjusted based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial situation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Target-Date Funds
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Target-date funds automatically adjust asset allocation based on your expected retirement date, becoming more conservative as you approach retirement. They provide a simple, hands-off approach to retirement investing.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Index Fund Investing
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Low-cost index funds provide broad market exposure with minimal fees, making them ideal for retirement investing. They offer diversification and historically competitive returns compared to actively managed funds.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Rebalancing
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Regularly rebalancing your portfolio ensures it maintains your desired asset allocation. This involves selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones to maintain your target allocation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Social Security Planning
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Social Security is a significant component of most Americans' retirement income, but maximizing benefits requires careful planning and timing decisions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Full Retirement Age
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Your full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which you can receive full Social Security benefits. For those born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. Claiming before FRA results in reduced benefits, while claiming after FRA increases benefits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Early vs. Delayed Claiming
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Claiming Social Security at 62 (the earliest age) results in a 30% reduction in benefits, while waiting until 70 results in an 8% increase per year beyond FRA. The optimal claiming strategy depends on your health, financial needs, and other income sources.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Spousal Benefits
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Married couples can coordinate their Social Security claiming strategies to maximize total household benefits. This may involve one spouse claiming early while the other delays, or both delaying to maximize survivor benefits.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Healthcare and Long-Term Care Planning
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Healthcare costs are one of the biggest retirement expenses, and planning for these costs is essential for retirement security.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Medicare Coverage
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Medicare provides basic healthcare coverage starting at age 65, but it doesn't cover everything. Understanding Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D, as well as supplemental insurance options, is crucial for retirement planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Long-Term Care Insurance
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Long-term care costs can be devastating to retirement savings. Long-term care insurance can help protect your assets, but it's expensive and may not be suitable for everyone.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Health Savings Accounts
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        HSAs can be powerful retirement savings vehicles for healthcare costs. If you have access to an HSA, consider maximizing contributions and investing the funds for long-term growth.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Retirement Income Strategies
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Creating a sustainable retirement income strategy is crucial for ensuring your savings last throughout retirement. This involves balancing growth, income, and preservation of capital.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        The 4% Rule
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement portfolio in the first year of retirement, then adjusting for inflation each subsequent year. While this rule has limitations, it provides a starting point for retirement income planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Bucket Strategy
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The bucket strategy divides your retirement portfolio into different "buckets" based on time horizons: immediate needs (cash), short-term needs (bonds), and long-term growth (stocks). This approach helps manage sequence of returns risk.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Annuities
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Annuities can provide guaranteed income in retirement, helping to cover essential expenses. However, they can be complex and expensive, so careful consideration is needed before purchasing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Common Retirement Planning Mistakes
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Avoiding common retirement planning mistakes can significantly improve your chances of achieving a secure retirement. Here are the most critical mistakes to avoid.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Not Starting Early Enough
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The biggest mistake is not starting to save for retirement early enough. The power of compound interest means that starting just a few years earlier can result in significantly more retirement savings.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Not Taking Advantage of Employer Matching
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Failing to contribute enough to receive the full employer match is like turning down free money. Always contribute at least enough to get the full match, even if you can't afford to contribute more.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Cashing Out Retirement Accounts
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Cashing out retirement accounts when changing jobs or during financial difficulties can have severe tax consequences and derail your retirement savings. Consider alternatives like loans or hardship withdrawals if absolutely necessary.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Not Planning for Healthcare Costs
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Many people underestimate healthcare costs in retirement. Plan for Medicare premiums, supplemental insurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, which can be substantial.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Conclusion: Building Your Retirement Future
