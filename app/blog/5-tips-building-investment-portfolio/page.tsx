        Building a successful investment portfolio in 2025 requires a strategic approach that balances risk and return while adapting to current market conditions. Whether you're just starting your investment journey or looking to optimize your existing portfolio, these five essential tips will help you build wealth systematically and achieve your long-term financial goals.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Tip 1: Start with Clear Investment Goals
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Before you invest a single dollar, it's crucial to define your investment goals clearly. Your goals will determine your investment strategy, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Are you investing for retirement, a down payment on a house, your children's education, or general wealth building?
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Each goal has different time horizons and risk profiles. Retirement investing might span 30-40 years, allowing for more aggressive growth strategies, while saving for a house down payment in 3-5 years requires a more conservative approach to preserve capital.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-6 my-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">SMART Investment Goals:</h4>
        <ul className="text-green-800 space-y-1">
          <li>• <strong>Specific:</strong> "Save $50,000 for a house down payment"</li>
          <li>• <strong>Measurable:</strong> Track progress monthly</li>
          <li>• <strong>Achievable:</strong> Realistic based on your income</li>
          <li>• <strong>Relevant:</strong> Aligned with your life priorities</li>
          <li>• <strong>Time-bound:</strong> "By December 2027"</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Tip 2: Diversify Across Asset Classes
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Diversification is the cornerstone of portfolio risk management. By spreading your investments across different asset classes, you reduce the impact of any single investment's poor performance on your overall portfolio. The key is to invest in assets that don't move in perfect correlation with each other.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Core Asset Classes for 2025
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        A well-diversified portfolio typically includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. The exact allocation depends on your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 my-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Sample Asset Allocation by Age:</h4>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-blue-800">
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span><strong>20s-30s (Growth Phase):</strong></span>
            <span>80% Stocks, 15% Bonds, 5% Alternatives</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span><strong>40s-50s (Balanced Phase):</strong></span>
            <span>60% Stocks, 30% Bonds, 10% Alternatives</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span><strong>60s+ (Conservative Phase):</strong></span>
            <span>40% Stocks, 50% Bonds, 10% Alternatives</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Tip 3: Use Dollar-Cost Averaging
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility and eliminates the need to time the market perfectly.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        By investing consistently, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, resulting in a lower average cost per share over time. This approach is particularly effective for long-term investors who can weather short-term market fluctuations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Implementing Dollar-Cost Averaging
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Set up automatic monthly or bi-weekly investments in your chosen funds or ETFs. Many brokerage accounts and retirement plans offer automatic investment features that make this process seamless. The key is consistency and discipline—stick to your investment schedule regardless of market news or emotions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Tip 4: Keep Costs Low with Index Funds and ETFs
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Investment costs can significantly impact your long-term returns. High fees can eat into your gains, especially over decades of investing. Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) typically offer the lowest costs while providing broad market exposure.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Look for funds with expense ratios below 0.20% annually. Many index funds and ETFs have expense ratios as low as 0.03% to 0.10%, which means you keep more of your investment returns.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 my-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Cost Impact Example:</h4>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-yellow-800">
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span>Investment Amount:</span>
            <span>$10,000</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span>Annual Return:</span>
            <span>7%</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span>High-Cost Fund (1.5% fee):</span>
            <span>$32,071 after 20 years</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex justify-between">
            <span>Low-Cost Fund (0.1% fee):</span>
            <span>$38,697 after 20 years</span>
          </div>
          <div className="text-yellow-700 text-sm">
            The difference: $6,626 more with the low-cost fund!

        Tip 5: Rebalance Regularly and Stay Disciplined
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Over time, your portfolio's asset allocation will drift from your target allocation due to different performance rates of various investments. Regular rebalancing ensures you maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
        Rebalancing Strategies
      </h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Rebalance when your allocation drifts more than 5-10% from your target, or on a regular schedule (quarterly, semi-annually, or annually). This involves selling some of your best-performing assets and buying more of your underperforming ones—essentially "buying low and selling high."
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Stay disciplined during market volatility. Avoid the temptation to sell during market downturns or chase hot investments during bull markets. Stick to your long-term strategy and remember that market volatility is normal and temporary.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        Building Your Portfolio Step by Step
      </h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Start with these steps to build your investment portfolio:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Assess your financial situation:</strong> Ensure you have an emergency fund and are debt-free (except for low-interest debt like mortgages)</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your investment accounts:</strong> Consider 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable brokerage accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Select your asset allocation:</strong> Based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance</li>
        <li><strong>Choose specific investments:</strong> Focus on low-cost index funds and ETFs</li>
        <li><strong>Set up automatic investments:</strong> Make investing a habit</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and rebalance:</strong> Review quarterly and adjust as needed</li>
      </ol>
