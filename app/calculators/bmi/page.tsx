          <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
          <p>
            Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using your height and
            weight to estimate body fat. It's a useful screening tool to
            identify potential weight problems in adults.
          </p>

          <h3>BMI Categories</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI less than 18.5
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Normal weight:</strong> BMI 18.5 to 24.9
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI 25 to 29.9
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Obese:</strong> BMI 30 or greater
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <p>
            BMI is not a diagnostic tool and doesn't measure body fat directly.
            It may not be accurate for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Athletes with high muscle mass</li>
            <li>Pregnant women</li>
            <li>Children and teenagers</li>
            <li>Elderly individuals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized
            health advice.
          </p>
